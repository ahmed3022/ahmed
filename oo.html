    <h1 class="text4">My experience with programming <small><i class="text6">( Copyed )</i></small></h1>
    <p class="text5">Opening: At first I learned programming. Seeing that the snake is very simple, I started with this language. But later, when I was learning the magical methods of python, I was so blind, I couldn't think of it! I really want to get involved in low level development and I want to write some low level software. I want to follow these great people to get involved in interesting open source projects on Github. But when I learned that the snake was not suitable for it, I was very angry at the time! Uninstall Python directly on windows!Note: I am now a manjaro linux user, I used linux, never thought of going back to windows.
        After: I gradually understand the language that developed python: the C language.
        Some people say that assembly produces C, and C produces everything. But at the time, I didn't know the truth, and I saw the amount of code and it was forbidden. Now when I really understand it, I feel its greatness. In order to learn C, I spent a lot of money to buy a book called "C Primer Plus". If anyone is learning this book like me, come to Station B and follow me. I am posting instructional videos for this book. (Of course, it's still in production) This book is very comprehensive, and almost every C language syntax is explained. So, the sixth edition of this book consists of 730 pages. But do not be afraid, read it slowly and complete it.
        
        However, I still like Python a lot, its syntax, and its file management, classes and objects. I still love the snake. It is just an interpreted language. So I had to migrate to C. I added Hello world of python and C at the end.
        
        But I'm still a beginner after all, and I joined the csdn family by chance. I hope my programming path goes further than that.
        I am a technical parrot. If you are interested, please pay attention. Farewell!</p>
